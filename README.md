# eBay-Shipping-calculator
Project to calculate shipping costs depending upon item, weight, height &amp; choice of carrier + mode of delivery.

The UI built is analogous to eBay shipping calculator site. This project uses Angular JS routing feature to come up with single page application. Also I used Oracle RDBMS for database modeling. 

Software Architecture document provides complete details about this implementation.
